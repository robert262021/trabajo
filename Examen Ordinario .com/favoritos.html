                    <h3>Jurrasic Park Arcade</h3>
                    <p>The game takes place on Isla Nublar a few months after the events of the film. The player fends off a vehicle from dinosaur attacks with automatic weaponry. A joystick is used to play, rather than a light gun. Dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus, Gallimimus, Brachiosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Triceratops, Ichthyosaurus, and Pteranodon.
                        Fences and large rocks that block the player's path must be shot at to avoid running into them. The game ends with the dinosaurs being caged once again.</p>

                            <p>The game takes place in the year 2018. John Connor arrives via a helicopter in Los Angeles to assist a squad of resistance fighters.

                                A team of resistance fighters carrying a special transmitter in the city was given a mission to call airstrikes on a Hunter-Killer tank to destroy it and recover its remains for research. However the team got attacked and was scattered. It fell upon John to recover the transmitter and complete the mission. While recovering the transmitter parts, he encounters the H-K tank. 
                                He is given the last transmitter part by a member of the team who tells him to find a way around the H-K tank through a nearby house in order to call upon an airstrike on it. John is successful in calling an airstrike on the H-K tank and it is destroyed.</p>
